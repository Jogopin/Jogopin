ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Junior Full-Stack Developer, enthusiastic about expanding my skills and tackling challenging projects. Take a look at my journey so far and the progress in my projects. If you're up for a chat or a project, I'm just a message away. Thanks for dropping in.

### PROJECTS
#### Groovz
Groovz is an e-commerce web app that offers a virtual store for headphones and speakers. Users can explore products, add them to their cart, and checkout using the Stripe test mode. The platform comes with features such as user authentication & authorization, admin accounts, responsive design, and efficient error handling. I worked on this project using React with Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and Express on Node.js with MongoDB for the backend.
